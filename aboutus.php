		<h4>
		The Anantham is an organization constructed on social contours by undergraduates from NSIT.
		Anantham was formed which is the confluence of streams of young thoughts that think to
		extend social contours beyond status quo with the help of education and other awareness
		drives. We want to redress myriad of social issues on student level which could help us gain
		emotional appreciation towards life, and a gift that is.</h4><br></br>
		<h4>From organizing awareness campaigns and plantation drive initiatives, we aim to redesign the
		social outlook that breaks the social norms and barriers and redefine the conventions to not
		only ensure progress but also ensure harmony. India is a vast country where five centuries of
		rituals can be seen alive in nook and cranny of the nation. The striation marks made on our
		democratic fabric makes us realize the need to persevere for social upliftment.</h4><br></br>
		<h4>Contemplation before coming to the bridge is what led Anantham to define this very purpose
		as nations are not built in a day, they are forged in years.</h4><br></br>
		<h4>Our aim is to redefine through qualitative education:
		Knowledge is power. Information is liberating. Education is the premise of progress, in every
		society, in every family.<br></br>
		The universe is an ocean and my life is a sailboat that floats close to the comforting shores of
		faith.</h4>
