	   <h2>Classroom Programs</h2>
			 <p>In the current scenario, there is lacuna for career selection for the privileged students in the family. When I say privileged in India, it means that the scholar possess enough resources and holds an emotional appreciation towards life as a whole to make it better. He can afford the basic necessities of life. The unfathomable inconsistency that slips into oblivion is the lack of signboards to guide a student to his career of choice. “Following the herd” philosophy needs to be redressed. They have more to eat than they have hunger.<br></br>

		<h2>Holistic Development</h2>
			<p>India is home to millions of people out of which a staggering percentage is unable to afford the basic amenities of life such as sanitation, shelter, nutrition, healthcare facilities and education. India has 200million poor students out of which 100 million are multi dimensionally poor. A multi dimensional poor child lacks in enough basic amenities of a decent life so as to incapacitate him in more than one dimension from the following:</p>
			<ul style=" font-family:Comic Sans MS;">
            <li>Health Dimension</li>
			<li>Education Dimension</li>
			<li>Shelter Dimension</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Such a travesty can be overturned only when a proper sense of inadequacy is realized and the proper resources are made available. Education is the parameter that we are targeting to redesign the outlook and provide them a life worth cherishing. Qualitative Education can fill the vacuum equipping them with an asset of living.<br></br>

		<h2>Vocational Hubs</h2>		
		<p>India has the largest demographic dividend in the world implying that the youth population is
		segregated and is disarrayed when it comes to efficient employment. Indian employment record is like a palimpsest where a new layer of unemployed is added without completely erasing the previous marks. Providing employment opportunity to the unemployed by providing the requisite would not help the individual gain self respect and earn livelihood but also make headway for the progression in one of the fastest developing economies of the world. We, as an organization would like to hone the skills of youth to provide them an asset of life. Harmonious advancement for the country can be soared by enhancing the abilities of the young.
